add scheduled date to metadata
add the action id to the metadata
make metadata a json that groups informations from commit, actions and status
ability for worker to add additional metadata (e.g. hostname, jobid)

move manager and worker to bulb and make it so we can start them through cli
give to the manager the ability to submit jobs to PBS



remove the need of a patch file by committing to the local origin
(only if there is a way to keep the branch/commit hidden until it is needed maybe with dangling commits)

coordinate jobs on multiple machines
(this would need the point above to be implemented so that the job, 
runnnig on a different machine from the one where it was submitted could pull the same code version)

improve the configuration system
ability to purge non-running work directories

add jobs.log visualization through cli
add data visualization capabilities through cli (like the notebooks i'm using for dp but maybe made with textual)

add the bulb version to the metadata
if more actions use the same code there is no need to duplicate it every time
